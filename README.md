# Forager-Single-Island
Work on updating the single Island challenge for forager

All code and data is pulled from the Forager files and therefor is used under agreement with the Forager team. 

I will try to look at request but until they add support for mods, i wont be able to do much about it. If anyone is intrested in assisting me or have any good ideas, feel free to ping me on discord in the Forager server.

Current Release:
- SingleIslandAllStructures_1.0.3_1.0

Guide to downloading and installing constructed save files:
1. Download and unpack the files from github.
2. Open up folder where Forager savefiles are located, this is th location on windows:
  %localappdata%/Forager
3. Move SingleIslandAllStructures_1.0.3_X.X into the local save file and rename it savefileX.txt. Replace the X with the number of the slot you want to use (0 is left, 1 is middle, 2 is right).
4. Run foragerand create a new game from the slot you picked above.
